# compass-streetname-hud-command
This is a edited version of: https://gitlab.com/MsQuerade/Compass-and-street-name-HUD/tree/master 

I added 2 commands
/compass - This wil turn on the compass hud (If you want to have it on by default change compass.show = false to streetName.show = true)

/streetnames - This will turn on the streetname hud (If you want to have it on by default change compass.show = false to compass.show = true)
